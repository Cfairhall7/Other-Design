*Other Design Studio is a Richmond, Virginia–based creative practice built on the belief that great design invites people to see the world a little differently. We’re a small, nimble team of thinkers, makers, and problem-solvers who approach every project with curiosity and a love for craft.
From brand identity and print to digital experiences and environmental design, we create thoughtful, visually striking work that helps our clients stand out—without ever blending in. Our process is collaborative, intentional, and rooted in Richmond’s vibrant creative community.
At Other Design Studio, we champion ideas that feel fresh, honest, and a bit unexpected. Because sometimes the best way to tell a story is to look at it from the other side.
